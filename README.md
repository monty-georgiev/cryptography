# Cryptography ciphers

This repository holds C++ implementations of some basic ciphers.

## Ciphers

1. Caesar cipher - one of the simplest forms of text encription.
Substitution cipher i.e. each letter is replaced with a letter corresponding to e 
key shift. In classical Caesar cipher, that shift is 3 ('a' becomes 'd', b becomes 'e' etc)

2. Rot90 - an algorithm that rotates a two dimensional array by 90 deg.

3.  Vigenère Cipher - developed by mathematician Blaise de Vigenère. Similar to Caesar cipher
however uses a keyword for the character shift. If the key is shorter than the plaintext, it is
repeated until the length matches.
