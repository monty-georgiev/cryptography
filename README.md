# Cryptography ciphers

This repository holds C++ implementations of some basic ciphers.

## Ciphers

1. Caesar cipher - one of the simplest forms of text encription.
Substitution cipher i.e. each letter is replaced with a letter corresponding to e 
key shift. In classical Caesar cipher, that shift is 3 ('a' becomes 'd', b becomes 'e' etc)
