<p>This repository holds C++ implementations of some basic ciphers.</p>

<h2 id="ciphers">Ciphers</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Caesar cipher - one of the simplest forms of text encription.
Substitution cipher i.e. each letter is replaced with a letter corresponding to e
key shift. In classical Caesar cipher, that shift is 3 (&#8216;a&#8217; becomes &#8216;d&#8217;, b becomes &#8216;e&#8217; etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Rot90 - an algorithm that rotates a two dimensional array by 90 deg.</p></li>
<li><p>Vigenère Cipher - developed by mathematician Blaise de Vigenère. Similar to Caesar cipher
however uses a keyword for the character shift. If the key is shorter than the plaintext, it is
repeated until the length matches.</p></li>
<li><p>Rail Fence.</p></li>

<p>Although I don&#8217;t find any practical use of the above examples, you&#8217;re free to use them in any
manner you like :)</p>
